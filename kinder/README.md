# Kinder

kinder is an example of [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) used as a library.

All the kind commands will be available in kinder, side by side with additional commands designed for helping kubeadm contributors.

**kinder is a work in progress. Test it! Break it! Send feeback!**

## Getting started

Read the [kind documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) first.

TODO....

## Create a test cluster

You can create a cluster in kinder using `kinder create cluster`, that is a wrapper on the `kind create cluster` command.

However, additional flags are supported for:

- Create *only* nodes or a working Kubernetes cluster (choose if automatically executing 'kubeadm init' and 'kubeadm join')
- Testing different cluster topologies (without using kind config files)
- Testing Kubernetes cluster variants supported by kubeadm (kube-dns instead of core-dns)

### Create *only* nodes

By default kinder stops the cluster creation process before executing 'kubeadm init' and 'kubeadm join';
This will give you nodes ready for intalling Kubernetes and more specifically

- the necessary prerequisited already installed on all nodes
- a pre-build kubeadm config file in '/kind/kubeadm.conf'
- in case of more than one control-plane node, a pre-configured external load balancer

If instead you want to revert to the default kind behaviour, you can use the `--setup-kubernetes`:

```bash
kinder create cluster --setup-kubernetes=true
```

### Testing different cluster topologies

You can use the `--control-plane-nodes <num>` flag and/or the `--worker-nodes <num>`  flag if you want that the cluster creation process.

```bash
# create a cluster with two worker nodes
kinder create cluster --worker-nodes=2
  
# create a cluster with two control-pane nodes
kinder create cluster ---control-plane-nodes=2
```

Please note that a load balancer node will be automatically create when there are more than one control-plane node;
it is also available a `--external-load balancer` flag to explicitly request the creation of an external load balancer node.

More sophisticated variations can be achieved using the kind config file, like e.g. customizing kubeadm-contig or specifying volume mounts. see kind docum

### Testing Kubernetes cluster variants

kinder gives you shortcuts for testing Kubernetes cluster variants supported by kubeadm:

```bash
# create a cluster using kube-dns instead of CoreDNS
kinder create cluster --kube-dns

# create a cluster using an external etcd
kinder create cluster --external-etcd
```

## Working on nodes

You can use `docker exec` and `docker cp`  to work on nodes.

```bash
# check the content of the /kind/kubeadm.conf file
docker exec kind-control-plane cat kind/kubeadm.conf

# execute a command on the kind-control-plane container (the control-plane node)
docker exec kind-worker1 \
      kubeadm init --config=/kind/kubeadm.conf --ignore-preflight-errors=all

# override the kubeadm binary on the on the kind-control-plane container
# with a locally built kubeadm binary
docker cp \
      $working_dir/kubernetes/bazel-bin/cmd/kubeadm/linux_amd64_pure_stripped/kubeadm \
      kind-control-plane:/usr/bin/kubeadm
```

Nevertheless, kinder offers you three commands for helping you working on nodes:

- `kinder do` allowing you to execute actions (repetitive tasks/sequence of commands) on nodes
- `kinder exec`,  a topology aware wrapper on docker `docker exec`
- `kinder cp`, a topology aware wrapper on docker `docker cp`

### kinder do

`kinder do` is the kinder swiss knife.

It allows to execute actions (repetitive tasks/sequence of commands) on one or more nodes in the local Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
# Execute kubeadm init, installs the CNI plugin and copy the kubeconfig file on the host
kinder do kubeadm-init
```

All the action implemented in kinder share are by design "developer friendly", in the sense that all the command output will be echoed. Following actions are available:

| action          | Notes                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| kubeadm-init    | Executes the kubeadm-init workflow, installs the CNI plugin and then copies the kubeconfig file on the host machine. Available options are:<br /> `--use-phases` triggers execution of the init workflow by invoking single phases. <br />`--automatic-copy-certs` instruct kubeadm to use the automatic copy cert feature.|
| kubeadm-join    | Executes the kubeadm-join workflow both on secondary control plane nodes and on worker nodes. Available options are:<br /> `--use-phases` triggers execution of the init workflow by invoking single phases.<br />`--automatic-copy-certs` instruct kubeadm to use the automatic copy cert feature.<br /> `--only-node` to execute this action only on a specific node. |
| kubeadm-upgrade | Work in progress                                             |
| Kubeadm-reset   | Executes the kubeadm-reset workflow on all the nodes. Available options are:<br />  `--only-node` to execute this action only on a specific node. |
| cluster-info    | Returns a summary of cluster info including<br />- List of nodes<br />- list of pods<br />- list of images used by pods<br />- list of etcd members |
| smoke-test      | Not implemented yet                                          |

### kinder exec

`kinder exec` provide a topology aware wrapper on docker `docker exec` .

```bash
# check the kubeadm version on all the nodes
kinder exec @all -- kubeadm version

# run kubeadm join on all the worker nodes
kinder exec @w* -- kubeadm join 172.17.0.2:6443 --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef ...

# run kubectl command inside the bootstrap control-plane node
kinder exec @cp1 -- kubectl --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf cluster-info
```

Following node selectors are available

| selector | return the following nodes                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| @all     | all the Kubernetes nodes in the cluster.<br />(control-plane and worker nodes are included, load balancer and etcd not) |
| @cp*     | all the control-plane nodes                                  |
| @cp1     | the bootstrap-control plane node                             |
| @cpN     | the secondary master nodes                                   |
| @w*      | all the worker nodes                                         |
| @lb      | the external load balancer                                   |
| @etcd    | the external etcd                                            |

As alternative to node selector, the node name (the container name without the cluster name prefix) can be used to target actions to a specific node.

```bash
# run kubeadm join on the first worker node node only
kinder exec worker1 -- kubeadm join 172.17.0.2:6443 --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef ...
```

### kinder cp

`kinder cp` provide a topology aware wrapper on docker `docker cp` . Following feature are supported:

```bash
# copy to the host the /kind/kubeadm.conf file existing on the bootstrap control-plane node
kinder cp @cp1:kind/kubeadm.conf kubeadm.conf

# copy to the bootstrap control-plane node a local kubeadm.conf file
kinder cp kubeadm.conf @cp1:kind/kubeadm.conf

# override the kubeadm binary on all the nodes with a locally built kubeadm binary
kinder cp \
      $working_dir/kubernetes/bazel-bin/cmd/kubeadm/linux_amd64_pure_stripped/kubeadm \
      @all:/usr/bin/kubeadm
```

> Please note that,  `docker cp` or `kinder cp`  allows you to replace the kubeadm kinary on existing nodes. If you want to replace the kubeadm binary on nodes that you create in future, please check altering node images paragraph

## Altering node images

Kind can be estremely efficient when the node image contains all the necessary artifacts.

kinder allows kubeadm contributor to exploit this feature by implementing the `kinder build node-variant` command, that takes a node-image and allows to build variants by:

- Adding new pre-loaded images that will be made available on all nodes at cluster creation time
- Replacing the kubeadm binary installed in the cluster, e.g. with a locally build version of kubeadm
- Adding deb packages for a second Kubernetes version to be used for upgrade testing

 The above options can be combined toghether in one command, if necessary

### Add images

```bash
kinder build node-variant \
     --base-image kindest/node:latest \
     --image kindest/node:PR12345 \
     --with-images $my-local-images/nginx.tar
```

Both single file or folder can be used as a arguments for the `--with-images`, but only image tar files will be considered; Image tar file will be placed in a well know folder, and kind(er) will load them during the initialization of each node.

### Replace kubeadm binary

```bash
kinder build node-variant \
     --base-image kindest/node:latest \
     --image kindest/node:PR12345 \
     --with-kubeadm $working_dir/kubernetes/bazel-bin/cmd/kubeadm/linux_amd64_pure_stripped/kubeadm
```

> Please note that, replacing the kubeadm binary in the node-images will have effect on nodes that you create in future; If you want to replace the kubeadm kinary on existing nodes, you should use `docker cp` or `kinder cp` instead.

### Add upgrade packages

```bash
kinder build node-variant \
     --base-image kindest/node:latest \
     --image kindest/node:PR12345 \
     --with-upgrade-packages $my-local-packages/v1.12.2/
```

Both single file or folder can be used as a arguments for the `--with-upgrade-packages`, but only deb packages will be considered; deb files will be placed in a well know folder, the kubeadm-upgrade action will use them during the upgrade sequence.
